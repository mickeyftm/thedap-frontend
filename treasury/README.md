# Treasury

### Notes

* Very important concept, people still tinkering about Defi/NFTs.
* Often misunderstood, keeping track of treasuries isnt a top priority
* Tedious process: Governance-&gt;Public Proposal-&gt;Soliciting Feedback from stakeholders-&gt;Voting for proposals
* Voting on a proposal \(Lobbying Stakeholders\) takes effort. Its a feature, not a bug. Spending money out of treasury shouldnt be easy.
* Simply copy-pasintg traditional capital allocation frameworks won't be enough \(asset management vehicles, corporate balance sheets, permanent capital pools like wealth funds, ....\)



> "Anything in a DAO that can be automated should be. Anything that can't be automated should be funded by the treasury."



### Principles of treasury management

**-Maintain an infinite time horizon**: Treasury should be structured to exist in perpetuity

**-Ensure inflows exceed outflows**: Revenue from the protocol plus returns of the treasury should exceed spending

-**Diversify:** Treasury allocation should ensure that critical expenses can be funded even if the protocol token has a significant drawdown.

> "Diversification is an important area to focus on at the moment given that the entirety of most treasuries are held in their native tokens. If UNI's price falls by 40%, its balance sheet would also shrink by 40%. If this drop in price were to occur at a time when the protocol might need to ramp up spending - whethere it is LP subsidies, token buybacks, core development, or M&A - this could lead to a further downward spiral for the token."

### Spending

The goal of treasury spending is to reward core contributors and attract the right set of new contributors.

**Coordinape from Yearn**: Decentralized treasury spending lets contributors select team members they've worked with, allocate points to members, generate a contributor graph, and get paid based on their contributions..

\*\*\*\*[**Pioneer**](www.pioneer.app)**:** Builders vote on their peers' projects, which generates a leaderboard based on votes weighted by credibility of voters

**Write race by Mirror:** Individuals and DAOs vote on who should get access to publish on Mirror, writers who are already on Mirror have more votes to allocate.



### Asset Allocation

Diversifying into stablecoins provides a protocol DAO with the following benefits:

* Maintain or ramp up spending in the event of a significant market drawdown
* enable yield-generation on Yearn, Aave and Compound
* Provide liquidity on stablecoin pools

Problem/Challenge: Requires selling native protocol tokens -&gt; negative perception

in search for stability-&gt;  SYI - [Stable Yield Index ](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/syi-stable-yield-index/1058)"highest risk adjusted stablecoin return"

### Token Buybacks

Treasuries should buyback tokens when they trade at a significant discount. Yearn has a policiy with YIP-56 to periodically buyback YFI with a portion of protocol earnings.

### Reporting

Browsing through etherscan SUCKS. It's transparent and you will get some info, but is the transparency useful? 

Nice to have some visuals like: [Yearn Q1 Report](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-pm/blob/master/financials/reports/2021Q1-yearn-quarterly-report.pdf)
